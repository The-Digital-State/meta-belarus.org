The digital state is a software project implementing political governance system resistant to corruption, misinformation and abuse of human rights.

The components are backed up by blockchain technology and together form DAO. The Digital State provides tools and documentation how anyone could set up and configure and launch the project for a social group of their choice - community, company or even entire country. The individual network configuration can be decided at the launch state or modified later through consensus.
