We're a growing consortium of different initiatives. Constantly and every
day we are developing digital tools for self-governance to make Belarus a
better place to live in. And we put the safety of our partners and employees
first. So if you've ever been contacted from the meta-Belarus name, please,
make sure that was one of the listed contacts. 
We would be greatful for signalling unautharized contacts to us as well.
